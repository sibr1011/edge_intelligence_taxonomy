# Edge Intelligence Taxonomy

Welcome to my repository for the data used in my seminar paper. This repo contains all the relevant graphs and .xlsx, .csv and .R scripts for the paper. Here you can find the decisions made to include studies or discard them. This paper was written for a seminar with the JMU in WÃ¼rzburg. I study business information systems (master).
